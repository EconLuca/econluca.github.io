Welcome to my personal website, nice to see you on here! 😇

My name is **Luca David** and I am a graduate student 👨🏼‍🎓 in Economics at the University of Tübingen 🇩🇪 and the Università degli studi di Pavia 🇮🇹.

On this blog-like website you can find out more about myself, especially about my work, interests and a bit of my normal life. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. 📧
